  # workspaceSizing configures the resources available to each workspace. These settings directly impact how
  # desenly we pack workspaces on nodes where workspacesPerNode = memoryAvailable(node) / memoryRequest.
  #
  # Beware: if a workspace exceeds its memoryLimit it is terminated which results in a broken user experience.
